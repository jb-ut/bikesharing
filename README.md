## Summary
Based on the data we can see that most users would be males who use bikes during work hours. We also see a lot of use during the weekend. We can infer that weekday users would be those people commuting short distances and likely live in the city. Weekend users are likely tourists. Most users tend to use the bikes no more than 5 minutes so there needs to be consideration for locations to ensure that there is an optimal number and that they are placed the proper distance from each other.
